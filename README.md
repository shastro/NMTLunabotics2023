# NMTLunabotics2023
NMTLunabotics Repo for 2023 robot and simulation.

### Rules
- Please keep `main` building/stable for the critical catkin packages, as well as simulator work.
- You can add code/tests that is too jank even for main directories to a folder with your name under the `/user` folder.
- Please make new branches for potentially breaking changes, esp if they were made in order to resolve system specific issues without testing on other systems.

### Documentation
- We should all try to document as much as we can this time around, it will make it much easier for later teams to build on our work.
